# AGENTS Rules

This repository follows the Dev Loop Stabilizer Kit rules.

## Safety
- No secrets or credentials in source control.
- No sudo/elevation assumptions in automation.
- Least-privilege command usage only.

## Change Scope
- Keep diffs narrow and task-focused.
- Avoid unrelated refactors while stabilizing local dev.
- Preserve existing module boundaries unless explicitly requested.

## Local Lifecycle
- Provide and maintain `make up`, `make down`, `make status`, `make health`.
- PID files must represent active listeners, not wrapper shells.
- Listener verification must use `lsof -tiTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN`.

## Validation
- Validate local startup/shutdown behavior with deterministic commands.
- Keep run instructions and canonical URLs documented in `docs/SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`.
